abstract: "A growing body of studies on systemic risk in financial markets has emphasized
the key importance of taking into consideration the complex interconnections among
financial institutions. Much effort has been put in modelling the contagion dynamics
of financial shocks, and to assess the resilience of specific financial marketsâ€”either
using real network data, reconstruction techniques or simple toy networks. Here we
address the more general problem of how shock propagation dynamics depends on
the topological details of the underlying network. To this end we consider different
realistic network topologies, all consistent with balance sheets information obtained
from real data on financial institutions. In particular, we consider networks of varying
density and with different block structures, and diversify as well in the details of
the shock propagation dynamics. We confirm that the systemic risk properties of a
financial network are extremely sensitive to its network features. Our results can aid
in the design of regulatory policies to improve the robustness of financial markets."
