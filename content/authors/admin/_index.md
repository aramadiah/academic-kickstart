Hi! I am a PhD Candidate of Computational Finance at the University College London. I enjoy doing interdisciplinary research at the interface between Computer Science and Economics. My main research interests are systemic risk in banking in finance, with particular focus on contagion and feedback mechanism in financial networks.
